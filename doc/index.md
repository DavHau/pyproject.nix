# [Pyproject.nix](https://github.com/adisbladis/pyproject.nix/) - Nix tooling for pyproject.toml projects

Pyproject.nix is a collection of Nix utilities to work with [PEP-621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) compliant `pyproject.toml` files and data formats.

You can think of it as a spiritual successor to [poetry2nix](https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix) that puts more of a focus on lower level plumbing and that aims to work with a plethora of package managers.
