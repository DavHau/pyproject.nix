# Reference documentation

The reference documentation is split up into two main categories:

- User facing APIs

Contains high-level representations and has notions of things like a `project` (a fully parsed `pyproject.toml`) and further operations done on the project level.

- Standards APIs

Contains parsers, evaluators & utility functions for dealing with Python packaging standards defined by the through the PEP process & from PyPA.
