# Pyproject.nix - Nix tooling for pyproject.toml projects

Pyproject.nix is a collection of Nix utilities to work with Python project metadata in Nix.
It mainly targets [PEP-621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) compliant `pyproject.toml` files and data formats, but also implement support for legacy formats such as `requirements.txt`.

Pyproject.nix aims to be a swiss army knife of simple customizable utilities that supports many use cases.
